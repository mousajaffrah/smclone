The user confirmed they want a detailed explanation of "type": "module" vs "commonjs" and mentioned they use bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, and other modules that are ES modules. They want to know if they should switch to "module".

I will prepare a detailed explanation covering:

What "type": "module" and "commonjs" mean in package.json
How they affect import/export syntax
Compatibility with ES modules and CommonJS modules
How popular modules like bcrypt and jsonwebtoken behave in each system
Pros and cons of switching to "module"
Recommendations based on their current codebase and dependencies
I will also mention the migration considerations if switching to "module".

I will now provide this detailed explanation to the user.


Task Completed
Your current project uses "type": "commonjs" in package.json, and your codebase uses CommonJS syntax (require/module.exports). This is fully compatible with most Node.js modules, including bcrypt and jsonwebtoken, which provide CommonJS support.

Here is a detailed explanation of the two module types:

"type": "commonjs"
Uses CommonJS module system.
Imports use require(), exports use module.exports.
Default in Node.js before version 14.
Compatible with most existing Node.js packages.
Easier to use if your codebase and dependencies are CommonJS.
No need for file extensions in require() calls.
Synchronous module loading.
"type": "module"
Uses ES Modules (ESM) system.
Imports use import/export syntax.
Supported natively in Node.js 14+.
Requires .js files to use import/export or .mjs extension.
Some older packages may not support ESM fully.
Requires explicit file extensions in import statements.
Supports asynchronous module loading.
Enables use of modern JavaScript features and better static analysis.
Regarding your question about bcrypt and jsonwebtoken:

Both packages support CommonJS and can be used without issues in CommonJS projects.
They also support ES Modules, but switching your project to "type": "module" requires updating your code to use import/export syntax and possibly adjusting file extensions.
If you switch to "module", you must update all your require() and module.exports to import/export.
Some packages or your own code may need adjustments for compatibility.
Recommendation:

Since your current codebase uses CommonJS and "type": "commonjs", and your dependencies support it well, it is simpler and safer to continue using CommonJS.
Switch to "type": "module" only if you want to adopt ES Modules fully and are ready to refactor your codebase accordingly.
If you want to use ES Modules gradually, consider using Babel or transpilers, or rename files to .mjs and update imports.
For most projects, CommonJS remains a stable and compatible choice.
If you want, I can help you migrate your codebase to ES Modules ("type": "module") with the necessary code changes and testing.

Please let me know if you want me to proceed with migration or if you have any other questions.
